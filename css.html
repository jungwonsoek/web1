  <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
     in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[
3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
 enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
 css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .
 css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
